# JavaFX based Media Player
This application is based upon JavaFX and Eclipse IDE. So, let us explore one of the features of JavaFX.
The active growth of media content on the web has made video and audio an essential part of rich Internet applications.
The idea of broadening the horizons of traditional media usage led to the creation of the JavaFX based Media Player that is available through a set of Java APIs.
For this application we would have three different classes the first one is our Main class which starts this application, then we have Player class to run our videos and audios and MediaBar class to control our media.
